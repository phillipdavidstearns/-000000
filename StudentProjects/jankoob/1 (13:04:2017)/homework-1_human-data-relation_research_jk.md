##Storing Data

####Computer memory/virtual memory

>	The term "memory", meaning "primary storage" or "main memory", is often associated with addressable semiconductor memory, i.e. integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based transistors, used for example as primary storage but also other purposes in computers and other digital electronic devices. _[(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language#/)_

####Memories in human brains

>	Memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968). Memory is vital to experiences and related to limbic systems, it is **the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.**[1] If we could not remember past events, we could not learn or develop language, relationships, nor personal identity (Eysenck, 2012). _[(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory)_

####Other 'storing methods'

**DNA**
> is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. _[(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)_

##Outsourced brain/external mind
**We already 'outsource' our brain capacity as well as (in some ways) our conciousness to (mobile) devices or services …**

>	Until that moment, I had thought that the magic of the information age was that it allowed us to know more, but then I realized the magic of the information age is that it allows us to know less. It provides us with external cognitive servants — silicon memory systems, collaborative online filters, consumer preference algorithms and networked knowledge. We can burden these servants and liberate ourselves. _[(David Brooks, The New York Times)](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/26/opinion/26brooks.html)_
