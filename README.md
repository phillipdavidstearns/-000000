#000000 Digital Dark Age - HSD FB D/IRAA Summer 2017

One can feel it behind the eyes like the fog before a migraine sets in. The buzz words humming like fluorescent lights, tumbling from the mouths of talking heads like water from the puckered lips of a stone cherub. Disruptive innovation, exit strategies, the New Normal, Post-fact politics, Fake News, Alternative Facts.

In the wake of the referendum on Brexit and the election of US President Donald J. Trump set against the backdrop of a European Union visibly in the grips of a sweeping wave of Nationalism, truth seems to be in thumbs of the Tweeter. In light of an apparent and culturally pervasive lack of regard for facts, my research will focus on reworking the notion of the Digital Dark Ages, a hypothetical future condition where history and knowledge become lost in an amnesia of techno-obsolescence.

## Contents:
